Hello World ðŸ˜Ž



In this fast growing world, to sustain in #business we need to adopt the agile process or say #devops environment. The future of Devops is Devops assembly line. To become agile we need to have robust architecture system and many resources. The best way to manage is by using container technology. In my previous articles we have seen that using container technology we can cut down the testing and production time with a huge difference and it's even automated. 

Few things which we can implement better and automated is in this article:

âœ” Dynamic slave on k8s

âœ” Buid Configuration using Dockerfile

âœ” Rolling updates 



Thank you Vimal Daga Sir for giving such a great training and taught us many things in such a short span
